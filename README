Mura Management Console

Wish Mura was a little quicker and easier to setup for a new project?

Mura Management Console is my attempt to solve my burning need to do very little when setting up a new Mura project.

CURRENTLY:

Setting up a new Mura site is a bit more work than I want it to be.

- Setup local repo
- Set it up on Github
- Download and Install Mura
- Activate Mura from setup screen
- Create Datasource
- Create Database and DB Users

- Create seperate repo for any plugin
- Maintain two repos, one for the site, and one repo for the plugin for that site with its' custom functionality.

WHAT I WANT:

- One screen, with one button. I enter in my project name, maybe some optional information, and MMC will setup an entire copy of Mura for me, with version control in place.  The very next thing I do after running MMC is login to the admin... or start coding.
- If possible, I'd rather have one long file containing everything making it easy to move around.

POTENTIAL CAVEATS:

- MMC would have to be installed in your webroot so you can use it via a browser to deploy more Mura instances.

ROADMAP: 

- Systemically eliminate every step.  I have bash scripts working locally to do most of the steps but putting it into a CFM script will get me going where I want.

LICENSE:

- You can hold me accountable as much as you paid for the code.
